h1. Publico Newspaper Crawler for Portuguese corpus creation

The aim of this Ruby script is to crawl the "portuguese Publico newspaper":http://publico.pt getting all the news available from the start page, extract their text, and from those their links to more news.

h2. Dependencies

* Hpricot
* Curb

h2. Technical Details

The script uses a queue and a set for keeping record of the news links to process and the ones already processed, respectively.

Processing the news links will be 15 threads opening http connections to them, extracting the news text (cleaning potential html tags inside), and getting some more links to news to add to add to the queue.

The script is made in a way that if it, for whatever reason, processes all the links, the current set will be serialized, so that when you run the script again only new links will be processed.

h2. Corpus details

The news are added to the corpus text file exactly as they were on the news page, only without html tags inside. First line of paragraphs may add extra spaces to the beginning of the line.
